# 5-card-draw
Five card draw poker game simulation done in C++. The program uses classes to represent a player, a deck, and individual playing cards. Game allows for 2 - 6 users to play at once and simulates the rules of the actual five card draw poker game. Program also allows users to replace cards they do not want for a better hand (Can only replace up to 3 cards).

# Motivation
This was my first project for my computer science II class for undergrad (Fall 2018). The class was all about objects and pointers in C++ so my professor at the time had his students simulate a lot of different games. 

# Problems
One main problem with this simulation is that sometimes the ranking system is off; So a player with a hand of type "One Pair" could sometimes beat a player with a hand of type "Two Pair". 

# Language
C++ 11

# Sample output
