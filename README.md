# 5-card-draw
5 card draw poker game simulation done in C++. This program was orginally my first project I had to submit for my Computer Science II class. The program uses classes to represent a player, a deck, and individual playing cards. Game allows for 2 - 6 users to play at once. One main problem with this simulation is that sometimes the ranking system is off (So a player with a hand of type "One Pair" could sometimes beat a player with a hand of type "Two Pair"). Program also allows users to replace cards they do not want for a better hand (Can only replace up to 3 cards).
